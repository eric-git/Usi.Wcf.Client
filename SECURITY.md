## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously.  
If you discover a vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, please report it responsibly via one of the following:

- Use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)
- Or email: **it@usi.gov.au**

---

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, affected files, etc.).
- Allow us reasonable time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix within 14 days.

---

## Security Best Practices

- Always run the latest supported version.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
- Avoid exposing configuration files (`.env`, `web.config`, etc.) publicly.
- Use HTTPS for all deployments.

## Credits

We appreciate responsible security research and will credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
